/**
 * Signing interface for disabling the acl. This annotation can be used on {@code Repository} interfaces or on domain
 * classes. If it's used on a domain class then all entities of that domain class could be accessed by any user. The acl
 * will be completely turned off for that domain class. If it's used on a Repository then the acl will be turned of for
 * all of the methods of that Repository, but you can still access the entities using acl restrictions via an other
 * repository what is defined without this annotation.
 * <p>
 * You can create multiple repositories for the same domain class. A non-annotated one for public access (e.g. for API
 * methods) and an other one with {@link NoAcl} annotation for inner use. (e.g. for scheduled tasks or console commands)
